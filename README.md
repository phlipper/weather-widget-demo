# Weather Widget Demo

This is a demo of a weather widget that I built using the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api). It is a simple widget that displays the current weather conditions for a given city. It also displays the forecast for the next 5 days.

## Requirements

* Must be done in Ruby on Rails
* Accept an address as input
* Retrieve forecast data for the given address. This should include, at minimum, the current temperature _(Bonus points - Retrieve high/low and/or extended forecast)_
* Display the requested forecast details to the user
* Cache the forecast details for 30 minutes for all subsequent requests by zip codes. Display indicator if the result is pulled from the cache.

## Assumptions

* This project is open to interpretation
* Functionality is a priority over form
* If you get stuck, complete as much as you can
